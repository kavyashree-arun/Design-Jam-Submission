        <p>Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenaged boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. However, the system failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi. Inspired by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the more financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya, where his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers in alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in November 2004.</p>

<p>By then a broad 22-year-old with long locks, Dhoni’s India career got off to an inauspicious start, as he scored a duck in his first ODI and a string of low scores followed. However, the selectors and the then-captain Sourav Ganguly decided to persist with him and gave him an extended run. Dhoni repaid their faith with an exhibition of his charisma and audacious stroke-play in his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who certainly didn’t see the butchery coming, as he butchered his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he went one step further bludgeoning his way to a brutal 183* in Jaipur to make a mockery of a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan attack that looked aghast at his bizarre-but-effective stroke-play and the unparalleled physical power that he imparted on the ball.</p>

<p>     In 1998, M. S. Dhoni, who had been playing only in school and club level cricket till then, was selected to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. He impressed Deval Sahay, an ex Bihar Cricket Association Vice-President, with his determination and hard-hitting skills, which opened up opportunities for him to play in First Class cricket.
During the 1998-99 season, he failed to make it to the East Zone U-19 squad or Rest of India squad, but he was selected for the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the next season. Unfortunately, he could not perform well and his team finished last in the tournament.
He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar cricket team during the 1999-2000 season with a score of 68 not out in the second innings. He scored his maiden first-class century during a game against Bengal in the following season, but his team lost the game.
Coming from a middles class Indian family, money was not a luxury for him. In fact, at the age of 20, he moved to Midnapore, West Bengal, after securing a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) job at Kharagpur railway station via sports quota. He served as a railway employee from 2001 to 2003.
In 2001, he was selected to play the Duleep Trophy for the East Zone; however, Bihar Cricket Association could not communicate this information to Dhoni in time, as he was located in Midnapore. He learnt this at a time when his team had already reached Agartala, the venue for the match. While one of his friends managed to hire a car for him to reach Kolkata Airport for a flight, the car broke down halfway, resulting in Deep Dasgupta serving as the wicketkeeper.</p>
<p>During the 2002-03 season, he continued to perform well in the Ranji Trophy and the Deodhar Trophy, which helped him get recognition. As part of the East Zone team, he won the Deodhar Trophy in 2003-2004 season, in which he scored another century.
He was eventually picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya during 2003-04. He took 7 catches and had stumpings during a match against Zimbabwe XI. He also helped his team defeat Pakistan A in back-to-back matches, scoring a half century in the first, followed by two centuries. With such performance, he got noticed by the then Indian National Team captain Sourav Ganguly.</p>
