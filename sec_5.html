        <p>MS Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devki Devi. His paternal village is in the Lamgara block in Almora, Uttarakhand. His father, Pan Singh, moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi and worked in junior management positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister and a brother-- Jayanti Gupta (sister) and Narendra Singh Dhoni (Brother). </p>

<p>Before marrying his schoolmate Sakshi Singh Rawat, MS Dhoni fell in love with Priyanka Jha, whom he met in his early 20s. At that time in the year 2002, Dhoni was trying his best to get selected in the Indian team. The same year, his girlfriend died in an accident. Dhoni also dated South Indian actress, Lakshmi Rai. Mahendra Singh Dhoni married Sakshi Singh Rawat, his school friend from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, on July 4, 2010. At the time of their marriage, Sakshi was studying a hotel management course at Taj Bengal in Kolkata as a trainee.</p>

<p>On February 6, 2015, the couple gave birth to a baby girl named Ziva. At this time, he was in Australia and 2015 Cricket World Cup was a week later. He didn't travel back and quoted 'I am on national duty, other things can wait'. </p>
<p>It was revealed in his biopic that M. S. Dhoni had been in a relationship with a girl named Priyanka Jha during 2002. It was an intense, but short lived affair as she succumbed to injuries from a car accident the same year. Dhoni, who had been travelling with the India A team at that time, learned about the incident much later and was emotionally devastated. It took him almost a year to get back on track for his professional career.
Dhoni started dating Sakshi Singh Rawat in 2008 after they met at Taj Bengal, where she worked as an intern after completing her graduation in Hotel Management from the Institute of Hotel Management, Aurangabad. Incidentally, the two knew each other during their childhood years as their fathers were colleagues at MECON and they both attended the same school, even though she was seven years younger to him.
The two dated for two years and got married on July 4, 2010, one day after they got engaged. The couple gave birth to a baby girl named Ziva on February 6, 2015.
After he won the Cricket World Cup in 2011, film director Neeraj Pandey decided to make a biopic on his life and achievements. The film, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, was released on September 30, 2016.</p>
